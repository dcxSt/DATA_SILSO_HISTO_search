# Des outiles pour changer la base des donnes du SILSO


## Preamble
The aim of this little project is to do a quality control of the data in *DATA_SILSO_HISTO*. Once the data is fixed and cleaned up, it will be stored on a new database - temporarily named *GOOD_DATA_SILSO* in a more user-friendly format to what currently exists. I will also get rid of any useless or redundant columns (such as the observers comment column - there are no comments )': ). A third, temporary database will be mad to keep a closer eye on the data that still needs to be examined with more scrutiny : *BAD_DATA_SILSO*. This database will act as intermediaire entre *DATA_SILSO_HISTO* et *GOOD_DATA_SILSO*. We will effectively be storing 2 databases-worth of information in 3 databases. The original *DATA_SILSO_HISTO* will have the old data and will be corrected in due course. The intermediary *BAD_DATA_SILSO* will start as a copy of *DATA_SILSO_HISTO* and end up empty as the corrected data is removed from it and placed, in the new format, into *GOOD_DATA_SILSO*

## Python scripts, their methods and descriptors: 

### db_edit.py
***utility methods used to edit the DATA_SILSO_HISTO sql database, for now it's just comments and flags***

 the rubbish bin that i made. With the same id it sees if this id can be found in
 redundant duplicates. It takes an id_number only! In DATA_SILSO_HISTO it moves it into 
 this method is the backbone of this script, who's sole purpouse is to scrap the

## Jupyter notebooks:

**suspicious sunspots plots.ipynb**  [code blocks = 21]  This notebook displays sunspot numbers which are unusually big. Here is also where the graphs that show the edits I made to Tacchini's data is stored.

**random_plots_and_graphs.ipynb**  [code blocks = 14]  Here there are the plots where I discovered Carrington and Kew's anomalous data which turned out to be the area measurements

**derived_plots.ipynb**  [code blocks = 8]  Shitty notebook that isn't very useful, I think I made this one before the other two, it has some Secchi plots as well as Carrington plots

**Frequency and number of observation plots.ipynb**  [code blocks = 11]  The following plots are to do with when and where who is recording what we have bar-charts that display the number of data-points associated with each observer and an event-plot that show for each observer, when they recorded the data they did

**Schwabe.ipynb**  [code blocks = 7]  Testing the home-made method: display_seperate_flags_all. There isn't very much content in this notebook.

**MittDBPython.ipynb**  [code blocks = 18]  One of the first Jupiter notebooks created, it's pretty useless now

**carrington_investigation_wolf.ipynb**  [code blocks = 15]  Notebook devoted to carrington's converstion from total area of surface of sunspot number into the derived sunspots numbers

**wolf_wolfer_investigation.ipynb**  [code blocks = 21]  This is the first notebook in which I test my display_wolf_drift() method in the hope of perhaps picking up on the drift of wolf.\nAs the title suggests there are also many plots of Wolf's and Wolfer's data as well as some people during their period of data collection.

**secchi_derivation.ipynb**  [code blocks = 17]  A bunch of methods were executed here to keep track of the derivation of Secchi's data when it was on-going. Because there are only to be executed once as they edit the databases, most of the content has been commented out with \

**carrington_investigation_groups.ipynb**  [code blocks = 7]  This notebook is dedicated to Carrington's data, specifically for the derivation / estimation of the sunspots number based off of his area measurements.

**executing_commands.ipynb**  [code blocks = 22]  This is one of the first notebooks I made, it's purpose is to execute commands that I wrote in the .py files, but it's pretty useless now. It was a good peduncle that lead to the creation of a better system (to borrow Alan Watts' analogy).

**kew_derivation.ipynb**  [code blocks = 15]  In this notebook there is the derivation of Kew's sunspots numbers from his area measurements. Since it's already been done I pickled the before and after and you can see the graphs without actually changing the data in the sql databases.
