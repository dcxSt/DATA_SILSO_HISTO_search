# Des outiles pour changer la base des donnes du SILSO


## Preamble
The aim of this little project is to do a quality control of the data in *DATA_SILSO_HISTO*. Once the data is fixed and cleaned up, it will be stored on a new database - temporarily named *GOOD_DATA_SILSO* in a more user-friendly format to what currently exists. I will also get rid of any useless or redundant columns (such as the observers comment column - there are no comments )': ). A third, temporary database will be mad to keep a closer eye on the data that still needs to be examined with more scrutiny : *BAD_DATA_SILSO*. This database will act as intermediaire entre *DATA_SILSO_HISTO* et *GOOD_DATA_SILSO*. We will effectively be storing 2 databases-worth of information in 3 databases. The original *DATA_SILSO_HISTO* will have the old data and will be corrected in due course. The intermediary *BAD_DATA_SILSO* will start as a copy of *DATA_SILSO_HISTO* and end up empty as the corrected data is removed from it and placed, in the new format, into *GOOD_DATA_SILSO*

## Python scripts, their methods and descriptors

### db_edit.py

**set_comment()**:	 return boolean T if updated, F if there was already a comment
 if there is already a comment, does not replace comment unless specified
 takes cursor, id and comment, and adds the comment to the id number


**add_to_comment()**:	 if there is no comment it sets the comment, if there is it adds to it

**set_alternative_flag()**:	 sets a flag with a number from 0 to 9 (inclusive)


**set_alternative_flags_multiple()**:	 same as set_alternative_flag but looks at each database and adds flag if there is a matching id_number


**remove_flag()**:	 takes id_number cursor and database connection and sets flag to 0


**set_wolf()**:	 sets the given wolf number based off of data ID


**set_sunspots()**:	 sets the number of sunspots : SUNSPOTS

**move_carrington_out_of_rubbish()**:	 moves them into DATA, in both DATA_SILSO_HISTO and GOOD_DATA_SILSO
 takes all carrington datapoints from rubric 303 that are in RUBBISH_DATA 


**move_carrington_to_good()**:	

### searching_the_manuals.py

**move_data_to_bin()**:	 because it deals with more fundamental operations that just duplicates
 this method is from dealing_with_duplicates.py but i copied it here


**transcribe_info_old()**:	 helper method for move_data_to_bin()


**transcribe_info_new()**:	 helper method for move_data_to_bin()

 the rest of the comments in the rubric are just marked *, so here we 
 pink is the colour for data with comments that have * = something and

 duplicates by date dictionary is a better dictionary, returns the dictionary

 cursor2,mydb2 is the recipient's cursor and mydb
 cursor,mydb is the sender's cursor and mydb

**move_data_to_bin()**:	 in BAD_DATA_SILSO it removed it entirely from the database (this is slightly worrying...)
 in GOOD_DATA_SILSO it also moves it into the bin
 in DATA_SILSO_HISTO it moves selected data into the RUBBISH_DATA


**move_data_to_bin_only_good()**:	 same as above but only affects GOOD_DATA_SILSO, doesn't touch the rest

**move_carrington303_good_to_rubbish()**:	 move carrington's data to rubbish from good data silso


### dealing_with_duplicates.py

**move_data_to_bin()**:	 BAD_DATA_SILSO if so it moves it removes it entirely from the database.
 GOOD_DATA_SILSO, if so it moves it into the bin. Then checks if the data is in 
 the rubbish bin that i made. With the same id it sees if this id can be found in
 redundant duplicates. It takes an id_number only! In DATA_SILSO_HISTO it moves it into 
 this method is the backbone of this script, who's sole purpouse is to scrap the
