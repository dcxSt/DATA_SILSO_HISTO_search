- [ ] Carrington datapoint id=31460 needs to go in the bin this is clearly a penumbra

allllllll observations in rubric number = 808 with fk_rubrics = 461 were made by Konkoly not Wolfer

All observations in rubric number = 820 were made by Wolfer in the year 1900 and not 1899, many observations are written correctly except for the year of the date, I found that the months and days correspond perfectly with what is written in the journals but not the year!

The Broger duplicates for 1899-03-17 and 1899-04-18 make very little sense, they are broger under two different aliases but in the same rubrics 801. There are only two of them so they can be done by hand. My guess is that they were punched in twice by different people and my identical duplicates algorythem has already dealt with the ones that were exactly the same, so these are the 2 instances where one of the people got it wrong.

Observations in mitt 129 rubrics number 02 (or 12902) were all made by Broger in 1931. Manny if not all of them were typed in wrong, it says they were made in 1908. Thankfully everything else about them seems correct.

For Rubrics 1057 and 1058 there is a serious problem - Both are labled with the wrong observer! 
Rubrics number 1057, the observations are made in the Capodimonte Observatory by Dr. E. Guerrieri,
Rubrics number 1058, the observations are made in Floreze by Robert Lucchini
I checked and both of these boyz are real observers with aliases, so this needs to be corrected.
The reason there is confusion about these two is because Herrn J. Sormano in Turin is mentioned since the observations come from letters of correspondence between Sormano and the two observers mentioned above. It is quite possible that this has been going on in other places under the radar. The only reason these two were detected was because they just so happened to be attributed to the same guy for observations on the same date. What I propose is that we have someone (perhaps me, Asside: maybe an AI could do this if we scanned every page of the journals and then trained a neural net to read the rubrics descriptors and figure the observer based on that... This might be hard for this task but I can see how some machine learning could come in handy for error detection and quality control) go through each rubrics number and make a list where every rubrics number is ascribed to an observer, specially for the rubrics descriptors that include the names of severy people, come to think of it a German person would proably do a much better job at this then me.
To speculate further it is possible that this issue runs deep and that many of the holes in the data are infact a concequence of the kind of error described above (by the way I can cut out alot of my rambling from the final draght of the report, or make a condensed version, I'm just in the habit of writing everything down so that future me can follow the thought process, sometimes it helps ok!)

Observations from rubrics number 1279 were incorrectly labled as comming from 1919 when infact they are from 1920. The observer (Prof. Anne Young) and all other info is correct.

Something annoying happens in 1929, Both Brunner - 'Wm. Brunner'  and his assistant - 'W. Brunner, Assistent' seem to be observing at the same time (BOTH OF THEM ARE DENOTED WITH THE ALIAS 'Brunner') with the same 8 cm aperture 64x magnification polarised helio-telescope. Rubrics 1624 (fk_rubrics=840) is Brunner and his assistent's observations are from Rubrics 1675 (fk_rubrics=842). I don't know what we should do, perhaps create another alias 'Brunner Assistent' (pink page marker)

Same thing happens in rubrics 12501 (fk=844) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 12503 (fk=846), this is Brunner Assistent (yellow page marker).

Same again in 1931. Rubrics 12901 (fk=848) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 12903 (fk=962), this is Brunner Assistent (orange page marker)

Same again in 1932. Rubrics 13001 (fk=964) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 13003 (fk=933), this is Brunner Assistent. also (fk=966)++

Same again in 1933. Rubrics 13101 (fk=968) this is the real Brunner, and rubrics 13103 (fk=970), this is Brunner Assistent. Crap! I just noticed that the rubrics numbers in the Mittheilungen here are associated with several fk_rubrics each. So be aware of this, the fk=xxx i provided may not be everything!

Same again in 1934. Rubrics 13201 (fk=972) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 13203 (fk=974), this is Brunner Assistent

And in 1935. Rubrics 13401 (fk=976) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 13403 (fk=978), this is Brunner Assistent

And in 1936. Rubrics 13501 (fk=980) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 13502 (yes that's a 2, no mistake) (fk=981), this is Brunner Assistent (dull pink pagemarker). The reason that it went from 01-03 to 01-02 was because prior to 1936 Boser was sandwitched between Brunner and his assistnet, he seems to have dissapeared.

And in 1937. Rubrics 13601 (fk=984) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 13602 (fk=985) is Brunner Assistent. (orange pagemarker)

And again in 1938 (I'm starting to notice a pattern can you see it?). Rubrics 13701 (fk=988) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 13702 (fk=989) is Brunner Assistent. (green pagemarker, page 385)

And in 1939. Rubrics 13901 (fk=991) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 13902 (fk=991) is Brunner Assistent. (yellow pagemarker p498, and yes i got the rubrics number right they jumped 138)

And in 1940. Rubrics 14001 (fk=993) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 14002 (fk=994) is Brunner Assistent. (bright pink pagemarker, p520)

And in 1941. Rubrics 14101 (fk=995) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 14102 (fk=996) is Brunner Assistent. (dull pink page-marker on p11)

And in 1942. Rubrics 14201 (fk=998) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 14202 (fk=999) is Brunner Assistent. (orange page-marker on p49)

And in 1943. Rurbrics 14301 (fk=1002) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 14302 (fk=1003) is Brunner Assistent. (yellow page-marker on p74)

And in 1944. Rubrics 14401 (fk=1006) is the real Brunner, and rubrics 14402 (fk=1007) is Brunner Assistent. (green page-marker on page 112)

Comments on Brunner: I'm annoyed that the assistant(s) doesn't have a name because we now have no idea how many there where. Also (s)he deserves credit for those 10 odd years of commited observation! Because this assistent has been observing with Brunner from 1929 to 1944 he at least deserves an alias. I propose 



Something strange happens with Messerschmitt, there are two different sunspots values written in for 1908-02-15, one of them has no rubrics number and values 3,17,47 The other has a rubrics number 1028 and values 2,7,27. So I looked in the journals under rubrics 1027 and for this date I found the values 3,17,47 which are the values written in where no rubric is specified. Very strange. There are a total of 4 duplicates for Messerschmitt and this is the only one that has a rubrics number. I find this very strange... I don't really know what to do. 

So I looked up in the same rubrics (1028) for the other dates specified. For 1908-01-17 there is nothing in the journal where there are two different inputs in the digital database. Same thing for 1908-01-01 and 1908-01-02.... :(

There are now more problems with rubrics 1028, some of the data are labelled with observer Wasnetzoff when in reality all the 1028 all of them are Metterschmitt. Write something to deal with this error, and bare in mind that it's probable what happend was the rubrics was entered in twice under 2 different aliases. Infact this hypothesis was just confirmed with a sear for the actual databases. All the rubrics=1028 (fk=951) datapoints should have their alias corrected to Messerschmitt (obs_id=138)





MOVING TO THE FILE same_value_duplicates.txt

The rubrics 195 (fk=40) is wrongly ascribed to Franzenau, the true observer is Herr Weber. The mistake was understandable made because it is written somewhat criptically (or at least to a non german-speaker such as myself)

There are a whole load of observations (like 30) by 'Tacchini et Millosevich' from the year 1880 which have NO RUBRICS and are in double. Neither is it specified in the comments who actually made the observation.
